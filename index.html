                <p class="text">Thirty years ago, if we wanted to communicate it was via post, landline phone calls or face-to-face conversations. Thanks to Tim Berners-Lee’s innovations in the late 1980’s communication has never been simpler. He had allowed social media platforms to expand, online ecommerce to boom and social activities easier than ever to organise - all thanks to one of his inventions: the World Wide Web.</p>

                        <p class="text">It all started back on 8th June 1955 when Tim Berners-Lee was born. Raised by Lee-Woods and Conway Berners-Lee (KidsKonnect, 2018) who were both computer scientists - so from an early age he had his mind set on which pathway he was going to follow. His early knowledge of electronics came from playing around with his model railways and focusing on the interactivity of them. (famousscientists.org, 2021).</p>

                        </a>
                        <p class="text">He spent most of his early life in and around London, especially with his education starting in Sheen Mount Primary School, which since leaving have unveiled a new hall in his honour. (KidsKonnect, 2018). After primary he started secondary education at Emanuel School in Wandsworth where he learned about computer science whilst he was doing his O-levels. He fully found himself when he was doing his degree in Oxford’s Queen’s College, and was often found investing things in his room, one example was when he was caught creating a computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop.

                        <p class="text">After obtaining his bachelor's degree in physics at Oxford, he started his career at a 
                            telecommunications company called Plessey. Whilst here one of his first official inventions involved 
                            the innovation of a typesetting software for printers. During this period Tim Berners-Lee spent a lot 
                            of his time working on distributed transaction systems & message relays. (famousscientists.org, 
                            2021). By this stage he already had quite an established knowledge in industry which he would use 
                            to go further and invent innovations which would later change the world.

                    <p class="text">After his successful tenure at Plessey communications, he 
                        started work as an independent contractor at CERN which was 
                        a European council for nuclear research. It was during his time 
                        here he had the idea of a lifetime. Whilst working at CERN, he 
                        developed a new program called ‘Enquire’. It was a simple 
                        hypertext program which would later lay the conceptual 
                        foundation for the development of the ‘World Wide 
                        Web.’ (Thefamouspeople.com, 2017) After a brief departure from 
                        CERN he returned back in 1984 after spending a few years at 
                        John Pooles Image Computer Systems.
                        </p>
                    <p class="text">During his time here he was given first hand experience in 
                        computer networking, some of the work that took place in this 
                        sector included real-time control firmware, graphics, and 
                        communications software. (Thefamouspeople.com, 2017)  Upon 
                        his return to CERN, he noticed that the company had a problem. 
                        CERN had a massive employee base, which meant a lot of work 
                        was being done, but there was no proper way of sharing 
                        information and data, which sparked an idea about how to 
                        share content more efficiently.

                    <div class="text">We rely on communication a lot, through daily life and work - it can determine whether you have got a job, attend an online awards ceremony, present important information to a group of people remotely.  I guess one reason how Tim Berners-Lee has changed the way we communicate is by how he has made it free and open source to everyone. At a click of a button you can send an email to a friend, accomplice or colleague via the HTTP and FTP protocols.</div>
                    <div class="text">It has become more apparent than ever the importance of online communication the past 18 months. Throughout the Coronavirus Pandemic, we have relied on services such as Zoom, Microsoft teams and skype to get us through meetings with people and share important information through a safe and recognisable third-party. Not only has it improved how we communicate, it has changed people's lives by how they work or learn, with these technologies it allows us to do a lot more from home making expenses such as travel, parking, food etc much less. Also in terms of online ecommerce with the likes of amazon, ebay and facebook market-place, it is easier than ever to buy and sell items and build a connection with your local community or even set up a small trading business. The way we look at the world has changed now through social media and the online influence it has on politics. People are becoming a lot more aware of the society they live in and sharing their political views to create agendas have become a lot more of a promaneient in recent years.</div>

                            <p class="text">It all started back in 1989 when he asked himself ‘how can we make sending information to people much more simple and effective?’ Tim had a clear vision and thought process and laid out his proposal to be heard. Initially his idea glossed over and was noted ‘Vague but exciting’ on the front of his proposal. (webfoundation, 2021). The project in question was never actually in any relation to what was going on at CERN, but he was spared some time to work on it in the background, along with his work at CERN. Tim Berners-Lee quickly got to work taking this idea further and begun putting it into action in September 1990, incidentially, it was created using one of Steve Jobs’ NeXT computers.

He created HTML, which is a coding language to create markup on webpages and build an overall structure of a web page. He also created the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) which we know today as URL, or the unique name/identifier to your website. And finally HTTP - also known as the hypertext protocol.

On 30th April 1993 CERN issued a public statement stating that the three components of Web software were to be made open source to the public which in turn sparked a global wave of creativity, collaboration and innovation never seen before. CERN would retain the copyright to protect the software from appropriation. In 2014, the World Wide Web reached it’s 25th birthday and at that point almost two in 5 people around the world were using it on a daily. (webfoundation, 2021).</p>

In 1994 after leaving CERN for the final time he set to work creating the W3C (Word Wide Web Consortium). (www.cs.mcgill.ca, n.d.). The main aim for the W3C is to set standards in web, these can range from compatibility, accessibility and development guidelines to make sure that everything which is being published to the web is appropriate and fits into their standards to help people view it, whom of which may rely on assistance.</p>

            <p class="text">To me, he is one of the biggest inspirations and influences in the industry and beyond. He has always appeared quite modest and layed back when praised for the work he has done to help billions all over the world. His drive and determinations is certainly something to be admired - and to read a walkthrough of his life from early beginnings to adult life and further, it’s really inspiring to see someone like this who just started off as a normal person who pursued his love for technology and electronics and end up creating a service which we all rely on day after day. Personally, as someone who loves the web and everything around it - from design and digital creation to development and learning different languages to get different outcomes, he will always stand out to me as someone that doesn't get the recognition he deserved for the work he has done. The fact that he invention is still being expanded to his day says a lot of what it means to people.</p>

                        <p class="text">It all started back in 8th June 1955 when Tim Berners-Lee was introduced to the world thanks to his parents Mary Lee-Woods and Conway Berners-Lee. [1] He grew up in London during the mid-fifties with parents who were both computer scientists – so from an early age he had his mind set on which pathway he was going to follow. His early knowledge of electronics came from playing around with his model railways and focusing on the interactivity of them. [2]</p>

                        <p class="text">He spent most of his early life in and around London, especially with his education starting in Sheen Mount Primary School, which since has dedicated a new hall in his honour. [1] After primary he started secondary education at Emanuel School in Wandsworth where he learned about computer science whilst he was doing his O-levels. He fully found himself when he was doing his degree in Oxford’s Queen’s College, and was often found investing things in his room, one example was when he was caught creating a computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop.

                        <p class="text">After obtaining his bachelor’s degree in physics at Oxford, he started his career at a telecommunications company. Whilst here one of his first official inventions involved the innovation of a typesetting software for printers. During his time working at Plessey worked on distributed transaction systems, message relays, and bar code technology. [2] By this stage he already had quite an established knowledge in industry which he would use to go further and mastermind innovations which would later change the world.</p>

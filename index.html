                        <p class="text">It all started back in 8th June 1955 when Tim Berners-Lee was introduced to the world thanks to his parents Mary Lee-Woods and Conway Berners-Lee. [1] He grew up in London during the mid-fifties with parents who were both computer scientists – so from an early age he had his mind set on which pathway he was going to follow. His early knowledge of electronics came from playing around with his model railways and focusing on the interactivity of them. [2]</p>

                        </a>
                        <p class="text">He spent most of his early life in and around London, especially with his education starting in Sheen Mount Primary School, which since has dedicated a new hall in his honour. [1] After primary he started secondary education at Emanuel School in Wandsworth where he learned about computer science whilst he was doing his O-levels. He fully found himself when he was doing his degree in Oxford’s Queen’s College, and was often found investing things in his room, one example was when he was caught creating a computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop.

                        <p class="text">After obtaining his bachelor’s degree in physics at Oxford, he started his career at a telecommunications company. Whilst here one of his first official inventions involved the innovation of a typesetting software for printers. During his time working at Plessey worked on distributed transaction systems, message relays, and bar code technology. [2] By this stage he already had quite an established knowledge in industry which he would use to go further and mastermind innovations which would later change the world.</p>

                    <p class="text">After his successful tenure at Plessey communications, he started work as an independent contractor at CERN which was a European council for nuclear research. It was during his time here he had the idea of a lifetime. While at CERN, he wrote a program called ‘Enquire’ for his own personal use. [2] It was a simple hypertext program which would later lay the conceptual foundation for the development of the ‘World Wide Web.’ After a brief departure from CERN he returned back in 1984 after spending a few years at John Pooles Image Computer Systems.</p>
                    <p class="text">During his time here he was given first hand experience in computer networking, some of the work that took place in this sector included real-time control firmware, graphics, and communications software, and a generic macro language. Upon his return to CERN, he noticed that the company had a problem – during the 1980s, thousands of people were working for ‘CERN’ and they needed to share information and data with each other. Which sparked an idea in his mind about a simpler and more efficient method of data sharing, had to be devised.</p>

Initially his idea was not immediately accepted – in fact his Boss at the time noted the words ‘Vague but exciting’ on the front of his proposal. [3] Although it was never an official CERN project, his boss Mike Sendall was able to give Tim some time away from work on it. Official work on this project started in September 1990, using one of Steve Jobs NeXT computers.[3]</p>

                        <p class="text">It took him less than a month to establish the three main technologies needed to create this idea. He created HTML, which is a coding language to create markup on webpages and build an overall structure of a web page. He also created the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) which we know today as URL, or the unique name/identifier to your website. And finally HTTP – also known as the hypertext protocol, this Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web. [3]</p>

In 2003, the companies developing new web standards committed to a Royalty Free Policy for their work. In 2014, the year we celebrated the web’s 25th birthday, almost two in five people around the world were using it. [3]</p>

I guess one reason how Tim Berners-Lee has changed the way we communicate is by how he has made it free and open source to everyone. At a click of a button you can send an email to a friend, accomplice or colleague via the HTTP and FTP protocols. The fact that it is free has started a movement which  sparked a global wave of creativity, collaboration and innovation never seen before. It makes services such as posting letters, job leaflets on shop windows, and newspapers nearly obsolete as you can do all of that via the web.</div>

    <section id="conclusion">

            <p class="text">To me, Tim Berners-Lee is one of the greats of the web industry and beyond. He has always appeared quite modest and layed back when praised for the work he has done to help billions all over the world. His drive and determinations is certainly something to be admired – and to read a walkthrough of his life from early beginnings to adult life and further, it’s really inspiring to see someone like this who just started off as a normal person who pursued his love for technology and electronics and end up creating a service which we all rely on day after day. Personally, as someone who loves the web and everything around it – from design and digital creation to development and learning different languages to get different outcomes, he will always stand out to me as someone that doesn’t get the recognition he deserved for the work he has done. The fact that he invention is still being expanded to his day says a lot of what it means to people.</p>
